Farzam wants to enter a balanced sequence of parentheses into his new computer, but he always has to use gloves due to his skin sensitivity to the polluted air of Tehran. Sometimes the parentheses are moved or entered incorrectly. You are supposed to help him find the minimum number of parentheses that must be changed to make the sequence balanced again.

The meaning of changing a parenthesis is to replace (with) or vice versa.

A balanced sequence is a sequence in which the number of (s) and (s) are equal. Also, in each prefix of this sequence, the number of (s) should be at least equal to the number of (s).
