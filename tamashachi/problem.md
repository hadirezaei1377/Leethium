The football match between the two teams Paozo and Corrie is about to start and the debate about which team will win has reached its highest level. According to previous experiences, we know that the team that has the best group of fans has always won.

This match has a number of spectators sitting in a row, and everyone is either a fan of Pauzo or Kurie, which we show the former as 0 and the latter as 1. Fan group is any colony (at least 1 person) of spectators who sit together and all support the same team (all 0 or all 1). The most rabid group of fans for each team is considered the largest of those groups.
