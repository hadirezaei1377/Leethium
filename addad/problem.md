Solve this problem for me with Golang programming language

Puya wrote a program that prints the numbers from one to five thousand in different lines, unfortunately, the \n character of his laptop had a problem and when he ran the program, he saw that the program printed all the numbers from 1 to n in one line and in In fact, a very large number was generated (that is, a very large number...12345678910111213 was printed in the output).
