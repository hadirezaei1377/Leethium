Majid is very interested in collecting magic.

Majid has N magic markers in his house, each of which has a color, which is represented by a number. Now, Majid's mind is occupied with the problem of which color has the least magic number.

Since Majid is very small and does not know how to count yet, we ask you to help Majid and print the magic color that has the lowest number. Also, if we have more than one color whose number of markers is less than the others, print the color that is less than the others among those colors.

Example

Explanation: Majid has 2 markers with color 1 and one marker with color 2. So the lowest color is color 2.

Sample input 2

Sample output 2
2

Explanation: Colors 2, 3, and 4 have the lowest value, but since the number 2 is smaller than 3 and 4, then the answer is equal to 2.
