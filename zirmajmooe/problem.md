Hossein, one of the strong students, was practicing programming using recursive algorithms when he came across an interesting question. Hossein, who was not yet familiar with the concepts of array and string, decided to move the boundaries of science and knowledge and solve this question as possible.

Write a program that prints all the subsets of the set of numbers 1 to n in the output in an order like the given examples.
The input contains only one line containing the natural number n.
output
Each line of the output contains a subset of the set of numbers 1 to n, and the members of the set will be printed with a space from each other.

Example
Sample entry 1
3

Sample output 1
{ 1 2 3 }
{ 1 2 }
{ 1 3 }
{ 1 }
{ 2 3 }
{ 2 }
{3}
{ }

Sample input 2
4

Sample output 2
{ 1 2 3 4 }
{ 1 2 3 }
{ 1 2 4 }
{ 1 2 }
{ 1 3 4 }
{ 1 3 }
{ 1 4 }
{ 1 }
{ 2 3 4 }
{ 2 3 }
{ 2 4 }
{ 2 }
{ 3 4 }
{3}
{4}
{ }
