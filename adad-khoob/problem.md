One of the professors of the mathematics faculty, who is very interested in the Genealogy Mathematics project, after studying the background of his professors and their professors, etc., which are in the large database of this project, finally reached the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss as his mathematical ancestor. In addition to great works in mathematics, stories about calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using formulas are also attributed to his school days. In this way, this mathematics faculty professor, to the numbers that are from the sum of the numbers 1 to
𝑛
n are made (such as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.), became interested.

He named these numbers good numbers and wants you to find their different divisors; But since he is very busy, he does not have time to write the desired program and he has asked you to write a program that
𝑘
k as input from the user and the first good number that is at least
𝑘
k has natural divisor as output.


output
The output of your program is a natural number. This natural number must be the first good natural number that
Example
Sample entry 1
4

Sample output 1
6

explanation
The first good number that has four natural divisors is 6.
