The atmosphere of Rahnama company is very friendly; For this purpose, in this company, everyone calls each other by their first names.
Following the arbitrary recruitments of the human resources unit, Rahnema has recently faced a fundamental problem of name similarity.
Unfortunately, when someone calls "Baqer" in the company, since there are many "Baqer" working in the company, it is impossible to understand which "Baqer" he means.
For this purpose, the human resources manager decides to buy exactly one colored hat for each person so that all those who have the same first name have a hat of a different color.
This solves the problem to some extent; In this way, from now on, instead of calling a person's first name, the company's employees will use the combination of "first name + color". For example, when we say "pink cow" we know that we have only one "pink cow" and there is no more ambiguity.
Now, the human resources manager has asked you to get the minimum number of different colors necessary by taking the names of people so that each person can be matched with a unique "first name + color" combination.
For a better understanding, pay attention to the examples and their explanations.
