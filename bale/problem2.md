After trying different programming languages, the members of the technical team of the ballet company decided to start working on their own and write a new language of their own.

After several meetings of the team in this field, they came to the conclusion that all their needs are solved with two conditional structures and loops, and the rest are extra things and they removed them from their language. Also, in their opinion, the entire code can be written in one line.

Therefore, they decided to use the bale keyword instead of the if keyword and end it with kheir. Also, they decided to use areh keyword instead of for keyword and display its ending with na. After designing their desired language, they needed a translator for their language to say whether their language can be translated or not, but considering their limited time and a lot of work, they asked you to help them do this work for them.

Entrance
On one line of standard input, a string is entered as the code you need to translate. The translation is that every bale must end with kheir and every areh with na, and these keywords must be balanced in the code.

It is guaranteed that there are no whitespace characters in the input code.

output
If the language was translatable, print YES on standard output and NO otherwise.

Sample entry 1
balex==1arehy==1y++nakheir

Sample output 1
YES

Sample input 2
baleball==1na

Sample output 2
No

Sample entry 3
balearehkheirna

Sample output 3
No

Hints
It is not possible to use libraries that are not available by default in Go.
