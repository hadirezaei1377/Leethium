One of Jamshid's friends sent him a Snap company discount code and introduced him to Snap.

After using Snap several times and introducing it to his friends and using the discount code for future trips, he realized that the subtitles of all the discount codes are the same. The sub-alphabet of a string is equal to the set of different letters that exist in this string. For example, if the discount code is XHx2ZLL, its subtitle is equal to
It will be 2, H, L, X, Z, x.
He now has a number of these discount codes.
  Jamshid wants to make sure that these discount codes are valid before using them. For each discount code, he wants to compare its subscript with the subscript of valid and used discount code t to find out which discount codes are valid. Since this process will take time, you will need to write a program to determine whether each discount code is valid or not.
