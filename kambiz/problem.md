Cambies has recently entered the business of proxy sales. He wants to broadcast his proxies IP. But because he doesn't want anyone to doubt him, he deleted the dots from the IPs!

  Write a program that converts the string s of numbers with correct punctuation into allowed IPs.

Entrance
In the only input line comes a string, which represents the string that Cambyses told.

output
The output of your program should contain the allowed IPs on separate lines. If the virtual IP is not found, do not print anything in the output. The order of the outputs does not matter.

Example
Sample entry 1
7151

Sample output 1
7.1.5.1

Sample input 2
55011859

Sample output 2
5.50.118.59
55.0.118.59

Note: Do not consider IPs such as 55.01.18.59 in which there are zeros before the numbers.
