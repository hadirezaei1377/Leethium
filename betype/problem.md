Alish, who can't write well recently, asks Pasha to write the sentence that is in his mind for him. Pasha, who wants to come to Steel, decides to type this sentence, but since he doesn't even know how to type, when he is writing the sentence, instead of the backspace button (to delete the last letter written, if any), he hits the = button. (Make sure that if there is a backspace at the beginning of the sentence, nothing will happen!) Pasha, who does not want his efforts to be wasted and wasted in front of his Ali, asks for your help and gives you the string he typed and asks you to write the main string for him.

The output should contain only one line, which is the string that Ali was trying to type.

Example
Sample entry 1
sall=am

Sample output 1
salam
Sample input 2
testtwo===wo
Sample output 2
testtwo
