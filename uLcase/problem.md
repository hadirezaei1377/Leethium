Farzad gave Daniel a hard drive and asked him to download all his movies for him. But since Daniel is an irregular person, the names of his movies are very irregular and jumbled. But Farzad, who is an orderly person, wants the first letter of each word to be uppercase and the rest of its letters to be lowercase. Help him sort the names of his movies. In the first line of the program, you will receive from Farzad the number of movies he wants to input, and then the unordered names of the movies. Then you will display the sorted names in the output as shown in the example.
