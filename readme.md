## Leethium

Leethium is a project aimed at enhancing skills in software engineering and backend development by solving challenging problems from Quera and in future leetcode platforms.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to improve problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of backend development concepts through regular practice.

### Features
- **Daily Challenges**: Solve one challenging problem every day to sharpen skills and stay consistent in learning.
- **Variety of Topics**: Explore a wide range of topics related to software engineering, algorithms, data structures, and backend development.
- **Tips and Solutions**: Share insights, tips, and solutions for each problem tackled to deepen understanding and facilitate learning for others.

### How to Use
1. **Select a Problem**: Choose a problem from LeetCode or Quera platform to solve each day.
2. **Solve the Problem**: Implement a solution for the selected problem, considering efficiency, correctness, and best practices.
3. **Document the Solution**: Document the solution in the code and provide explanations, insights, and any relevant tips.
4. **Test Your Solution**: Test the solution with various test cases to ensure its correctness and efficiency.
5. **Share Your Experience**: Optionally, share your experience, challenges faced, and lessons learned while solving the problem.

### Example
For example, let's consider the Two Sum problem.
This is just an example to illustrate how problems are approached and solved within the Leethium project.
