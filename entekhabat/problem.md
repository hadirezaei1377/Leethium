If there are n candidates
First, each candidate is assigned a number from 1 to n during a lottery ceremony. Candidates sit around a table in the order of their numbers and are removed one by one starting from number 2.

Now, using the return function, write a program that prints the number of the winning candidate by taking the number of candidates from the input.

Example
Sample entry 1
