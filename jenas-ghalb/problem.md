A heart pun is a string that is the same if you write it from either side. For example, the word radar and if we don't consider the distances, the phrase a man a plan a canal Panama is a heart pun.

In this program you are asked to return a function called

int IsPalindrome(char *)

Write to recursively determine whether the input string is a heart pun or not. This return function should not take into account blank spaces, punctuation marks, and case letters.
